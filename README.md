# System Hardening for AWS Windows Infrastructure

A comprehensive, enterprise-grade system hardening solution designed specifically for Windows Server environments deployed on AWS. This project addresses the critical security challenges of implementing CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks on mature, production-ready codebases while maintaining operational functionality and compliance requirements.

## üéØ Executive Overview

### Purpose

This repository provides a complete, automated system hardening framework that transforms Windows Server instances into highly secure, compliance-ready infrastructure suitable for enterprise production environments. The solution addresses the complex challenge of applying stringent security controls to existing systems without breaking critical business functionality.

### Key Challenges Addressed

#### 1. **Mature Codebase Integration**
- **Legacy Application Compatibility**: Many enterprise applications were built before modern security standards, making them incompatible with strict CIS controls
- **Dependency Management**: Existing applications often depend on deprecated protocols, weak encryption, or insecure configurations
- **Custom Configuration Requirements**: Production systems have unique configurations that must be preserved during hardening

#### 2. **Operational Continuity**
- **Zero-Downtime Deployment**: Hardening must be applied without disrupting business operations
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Complete rollback procedures for every security control implemented
- **Gradual Implementation**: Phased approach allowing testing and validation at each step

#### 3. **Compliance Complexity**
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Simultaneous compliance with CIS, NIST, OWASP, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and HIPAA
- **Audit Trail Requirements**: Comprehensive logging and documentation for regulatory compliance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time compliance monitoring and alerting

#### 4. **AWS-Specific Challenges**
- **AMI-Based Deployment**: Hardening must be integrated into AMI creation and launch processes
- **Cloud Security Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS security services and IAM
- **Scalability Requirements**: Solutions must work across single instances and large-scale deployments
